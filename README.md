<br>

The repository contains three programs simulating a shop. They are built using:

  * C Procedural Programming
  * Python Procedural Programming
  * Java Object Oriented Programming

Each program has the following features:
  * Display of the shop stock and current cash.
  * Reading and processing customer orders from a CSV file.
  * Live mode where the orders typed in by the user.
  * Possibility of order fulfillment (checks for insufficient funds and stock shortages)
  * The stock CSV file is updated accordingly with each successful purchase.
  * Identical “user experience” of each implementation.
