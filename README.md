<br>

The project contains three programs simulating a shop. They are built using:

  * C Procedural Programming
  * Python Procedural Programming
  * Java Object Oriented Programming

Each program has the following features:
  * Display of the shop stock and current cash. 
  * Reading and processing customer orders from a CSV file
  * Live mode operation where the orders are entered by a user
  * Checks for insufficient funds and stock shortages. 
  * The stock CSV file is updated accordingly with each successful
  * Identical “user experience” of each implementation. 
 
Additionally, there are 4 csv files: 1 with shop stock and 3 with customer orders, and a report outlining similarities and differences between the procedural and the object-oriented approach.
